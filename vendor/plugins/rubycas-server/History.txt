=== 0.7.0 :: In Progress

* Implemented single-sign-out functionality as specified in CAS 3.1.  See
  http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CASUM/Single+Sign+Out.
* It is now possible to configure Authenticators to return extra attributes
  to CAS clients alongside the username. For an example of how to do this see
  the included SQL authenticator. Also have a look at:
  http://groups.google.com/group/rubycas-server/browse_thread/thread/5eade3793cb590e9
* Service URIs are now automatically normalized. For example, if the service 
  URI given to the server has a 'ticket' parameter, the ticket will now be 
  automatically stripped. This is to avert any possible issues raised by 
  misbehaving CAS clients (the CAS ticket should never be part of the service 
  URI). Same goes for other CAS-related parameters like 'service', 'renew',
  and 'gateway'. Additionally, the trailing '/' and '?' characters are
  automatically stripped from URLs, since, for example, "http://google.com/"
  is almost certainly equivalent to "http://google.com".
* The expire_sessions config variable is now respected -- ticket granting
  ticket cookies are set with an expiry datetime, so that the SSO session
  is effectively terminated once the ticket_granting_ticket_expiry period
  is reached.
* If present, the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR header is used for recording the
  client's address. This is useful when the server is running behind a reverse
  proxy, but it should not be considered authoritative since it can be
  easily spoofed.
* The 'service' field in the 'casserver_st' table has been changed from
  VARCHAR(255) to TEXT in order to accomodate service URIs longer than 255
  characters (fixes issue #46).
* The CAS XML responses are no longer whitespace-formatted (i.e. Markaby's
  auto-indentation has been turned off). Apparently the whitespace was
  causing problems with mod_auth_cas. See:
  http://groups.google.com/group/rubycas-server/browse_thread/thread/e482fe09999b73d3
* Fixed logout action to work with ActiveRecord 2.1 (eager loading behaviour
  was changed upstream forcing a change to the way we look for ProxyGrantingTickets
  to delete on logout).
* Added an MD5-password version of the SQL authenticator for Drupal and any other
  database that stores its passwords in hashed form (thanks malcolmm).

=== 0.6.0 :: 2008-03-28

* Much of the supporting functionality that makes RubyCAS-Server
  act as a well-behaved Linux service has been abstracted out
  into its own library. This new library is called Picnic and is
  now a gem dependency for RubyCAS-Server. You can find out more about
  it at http://code.google.com/p/camping-picnic/.
* The logout action will now accept a 'destination' parameter in lieu of
  'service'. This means that if a 'destination' parameter is given with
  some URL, the logout action will show the login form, allowing the user
  to immedietly log back in to the service specified by 'destination'.
* The logout action will now accept a 'url' parameter. If given, the logout
  page will show a message indicating that the CAS session has been terminated
  and instructing the user to click on a link to follow the given URL. If the
  'url' parameter is given, the login form will NOT be shown on the logout
  page (see above).
* When an authentication failure occurs (because the user submitted
  invalid credentials or the login ticket is missing), the server
  now returns a 401 (Unauthorized) response instead of 200.
* An encryption-enabled version of the SQL authenticator is now
  available. For more info have a look at:
  http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-server/wiki/UsingTheSQLEncryptedAuthenticator
* Better compatibility with Oracle databases. The database migration 
  no longer tries to create tables with long names when long
  table names are not supported by the underlying database connector
  (issue #15).
* The server now automatically removes leading and trailing whitespace from
  the username entered by users. Passwords however are left intact, with no
  whitespace removed.
* The server can now be configured to automatically downcase the
  username entered by users (dowcase_username option). So if a user
  enters "JSmith", the system will convert it to "jsmith" if the
  downcase_username option is set to true.
* The server can now be made to bind to a specific address. See the
  :bind_address option in the config.example.yml file.
* Fixed bug with ActiveRecord 2.0.2 where service tickets were not
  being given a type (issue #37).

=== 0.5.1 :: 2007-12-20

* Tickets generated by the server should now be a lot more secure.
  The random string generator used for generating tickets now uses
  Crypt::ISAAC. Tickets have also been extended in length; STs, PTs
  and LTs can now extend up to 32 characters, and PGTs and PGT-IOUs 
  up to 64.

=== 0.5.0 :: 2007-09-20

* Gateway requests should now be handled correctly. When the request to the
  login page is made with gateway=true as one of the parameters, the CAS
  server will immediately redirect back to the target service along with
  a service ticket if an SSO session exists for the user (or without a
  service ticket if there is no pre-existing SSO session). 
  Note that if you are using RubyCAS-Client and want gatewaying, you will 
  need to upgrade it to 1.1.0 as gatewaying was broken in prior versions.
* If gateway=true is specified as part of the logout URI, the server will
  log the user out and immediately redirect them back to the specified
  service. In other words, you can now do "gatewayed logouts" as well
  as logins.
* A login ticket can now be remotely requested from the server by placing
  a POST request to '/loginTicket'.
* The login view can now be made to return only the login form. This is
  done by adding the 'onlyLoginForm' parameter to the '/login' request.
  Optionally, a 'submitToURI' parameter can be supplied to force the login
  form to submit to the given URI (otherwise the server will try to figure
  out the full URI to its own login controller). This functionality may be
  useful when you want to embed the login form in some external page, as
  an IFRAME otherwise.
* Custom views can now be used to override the default Markaby templates
  by specifying a 'custom_views_file' option in the configuration. See
  custom_views.example.rb. [jzylks]
* Table names have been shortened to work with Oracle. A migration has
  been added that should do the shortening for you the first time you run
  this new RubyCAS-Server version.
* Multiple authenticators can now be specified. During authentication,
  credentials are presented to the first authenticator, then the second,
  and so on, until the user is validated by any one authenticator or fails 
  validation for all of them. [jzylks]
* When using webrick, you can now run with SSL disabled by omitting the 
  ssl_cert and ssl_key parameters.
* Changed incorrect MySQL example database configuration -- option should
  be 'host:' not 'server:' (issue #22).

=== 0.4.2 :: 2007-07-26

* The LDAP/AD authenticator has been largely re-written. The code is a bit
  cleaner now, and should work better with non-Active Directory LDAP servers
  (although this has yet to be tested since I don't have access to a non-AD
  LDAP server).
* The validate() method in your authenticators now receives a :service element
  (in addition to :username, and :password). This is simply the service
  url (if any) specified in the user's CAS request. If you call 
  read_standard_credentials(credentials) at the top of your validator, the value
  will also be available as @service along with @username and @password.
* By request, a :username_prefix option has been added to the ldap 
  configuration. If entered, this string will be automatically prefixed to 
  the username entered by the user.
* A bug having to do with handling authenticator errors has been fixed.
  Any authenticator error messages should now be correctly shown on the
  login page.
* Minor improvements to error messages having to do with login tickets.
  They're a bit more prescriptive now, explaining to the user what steps
  they should take to correct the error.

=== 0.4.1 :: 2007-06-07

* This release restores compatiblity with older versions of rubygems
  (pre-0.9.0). To achieve this, we alias the 'gem' method to the old 
  'require_gem' if 'gem' is not already defined.
* rubycas-server-ctl will now quiety delete an orphaned .pid file 
  instead complaining loudly and refusing to start up.
* Fixed minor bug in rubycas-server-ctl that sometimes incorrectly reported
  startup problems when in fact the server had started just fine.


=== 0.4.0 :: 2007-06-05

* Added rubycas-server-ctl script for controlling daemonized server.
* rubygems-0.9.0 or later is now required.
* Added system startup script to be used in /etc/init.d on Linux systems.
* Authenticator can now be loaded from an external file using the 'source'
  configuration option.
* Better preemptive detection of startup problems with mongrel.
* User now sees an error message if the service URI is not a valid URI (i.e.
  if it's not URI-encoded or otherwise malformed).


=== 0.3.0 :: 2007-03-29

* Fixed glaring security problem with LDAP/AD Authenticator where under some
  circumstances blank passwords were accepted as valid.
* Autocomplete has been turned off on the password field for better security.
  In the future we may allow autocomplete to be re-enabled using a
  configuration setting.
* When the user visits the login page and is already authenticated (i.e. they
  have a valid ticket granting cookie), a message is shown at the top 
  indicating that they are already logged in.
* sqlite3-ruby is no longer required by the gem as a dependency.  The user 
  must now install it manually prior to installing rubycas-server. The
  building of sqlite3 native extensions appears to be somewhat flakey
  and probably defeats the original purpose of using it (which was
  to have a CAS server up and running with no additional DB configuration).
  We will use MySQL as the default database adapter instead, since it does
  not require additional libraries and many users will have a MySQL server
  already available.
* Fixed bug that was causing all proxy-granting tickets to be deleted whenever
  any user logged out. Only the PGTs for the user that is logging out are now
  being deleted.
* Trailing slashes in service URLs are now ignored when validating service
  and proxy tickets (e.g. "http://www.google.com" and "http://www.google.com/"
  are now considered to be the same service URL).
* Authenticators now raise AuthenticatorError exceptions when encountering
  a problem/error. This makes it easier to send feedback to the user.
  However, other exceptions should still be raised when errors ought
  not be recoverable (i.e. programming errors).
* Fixed serious vulnerability in LDAP authenticator where under some
  cirumstances the user could just enter '*' as their username to match 
  any username. The LDAP authenticator will now refuse to process logins 
  with usernames that contain the characters * ( ) \ / and the NULL 
  character \0.
* Views are no longer xhtml-validated. Markaby's auto-validation was turned
  off to allow for use of the autocomplete property on inputs, since this is
  the only viable way of turning off password storage in IE and Firefox at
  the page level.
* You can now limit the maximum length of a login session by setting the
  expire_sessions config setting to true.
* Fixed some minor bugs in the login view.


=== 0.2.0 :: 2007-03-20

* ruby-casserver now behaves more like a real command-line app, accepting
  various command line arguments including -h (help), -v (version), -c (use
  an alternate config.yml), and -d (daemonize, when using webrick or mongrel 
  mode).
* Special characters in CAS XML responses are now properly encoded into XML
  entities
* CAS XML responses are no longer auto-indented... Markaby's indentation
  seemed to be causing problems with the PHP CAS client.
* Misc minor bug fixes/cleanup.


=== 0.1.0 :: 2007-03-01

* First public release.
